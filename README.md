Continued working on district files. Added indexes. Removed extra columns. Added flags. Joined files.
<br>Will go through and review files to see what indicators may be missing.
<br>I think if we focus on the district data for now, we can go back and look at the campus data if we have time.  The district data is the most interesting at this point.

<br>Added a project jupyter notebook file which reads the data files into data frames.<br><br>
For the spreadsheets that have them, I want to read in the second sheet and assign these as column labels.  I haven't figured out how to do that yet.
